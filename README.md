Checkout System with MUI

I took my job interview assignment project (Link: https://github.com/Illnas/Kodius-Checkout-Project ) and decided
to give it a little polish and use this opportunity to practive using MUI. 

I used MUI in some parts (click effects, date input) because it keeps making codes and logic in components
confusing to read through.

Next thing to do would be, creating either custom Hooks or separate JS files to house some of the logic.
And, this will require quite the research.
